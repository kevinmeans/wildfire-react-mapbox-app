# Wildfire React Mapbox App

This is a react application that primarily runs a mapbox interface to locate wildfire.  The application hits a nodejs backend to retrieve wildfire location data from a mysql database.  There is a heatmap overlay on the mapbox application that will only display data points in a cluster of critical mass.
